<h3><span class="title">Getting Started</span></h3>

<p>Reversi is a two player board game played with colored pieces on a board
divided into 64 squares. To win the game you need to have more pieces on the
board than your opponent.</p>

<p>The board starts with two red pieces and two blue pieces in the center. Your
pieces are red and your opponent's are blue. You should also see four
translucent red pieces which show the four squares where you are allowed to
place one of your pieces; moves are only allowed where at least one of your
opponent's pieces will be flipped. </p>

<p>To play the game touch one of the translucent red pieces on the board to
make your move. You will see your new piece appear and one of the blue pieces
flip over to become one of your red pieces. The blue piece is flipped because
it is in a line, straight or diagonal, between two of your red pieces. While
the blue player is thinking you will see some translucent blue pieces showing
the blue player's legal moves. </p>

<p>Once the blue player has placed a piece it will be your turn again. play
continues to alternate until one player cannot move. </p>

<p>The winner is the player with the most pieces.</p>

the game plus a progress indicator that appears when the computer is thinking.
